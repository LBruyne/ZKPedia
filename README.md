# ZKPedia

This repository is _an encyclo**pedia** of **Z**ero **K**nowledge **P**roof._ Zero Knowledge Proof (**ZKP**) is a special family of Verifiable Computing (**VC**) which has an extra property called Zero Knowledge, actually. It has been proved that any VC system can be converted into a zero-knowledge version additionally. So it is important for researchers to learn VC system as well. The repository records the basic concepts of **VC** and **ZKP**, and a series of important articles and books in these areas (which are classical or novel achievements from a aspect of academic), along with some actual applications in various scienarios as well.

The repository is also for recording my personal researches in Verifiable Computing and Zero Knowledge Proof area.

We'd like to collect other awesome materials as well, if they are related. Any useful revisions and pull requests (PR) are welcomed!



## [Introduction](introduction.md)&#x20;

What's Zero Knowledge Proof? And what does zk-SNARKs, zk-STARK... mean? What about interactive proofs and non-interactive proofs? Here gives an overview of these "profound" terms.



## Tech Terms

These are some important technique terms (or, preliminaries, in a researcher's tongue) that may be learned before diving into this area. Some of the terms may appear during the journey as well.
