# Introduction

Introduced in 1980s, Verifiable Computing (VC) refers to the cryptographic primitive called Interactice Proofs (IPs) and arguments, which allows a prover $$\mathcal{P}$$ to convince a verifier $$\mathcal{V}$$ that a delegated computation is correctly performed.

In mathematical terms, VC can be defined as a process where the verifier as a party, checks the output of a computation performed by the prover. This is achieved by using cryptographic techniques, such as homomorphic encryption or other subtle protocols, even their composition, to allow the verifier to validate the result of the computation without revealing any confidential information. The goal of verifiable computing is to provide a way to ensure the correctness and integrity of the computation, while still preserving privacy and security.

Generally speaking, we can view verifiable computing and iteractive protocols the same thing, or we can say IPs are the most important scheme to implement VC.
